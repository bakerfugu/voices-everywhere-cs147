This moment is bittersweet, to say the least. Our team met as four strangers with little web development, app development, or design experience. After ten weeks working together as a team, we have not only grown close to one another as friends but we have also built a product together. Over the course of the project, we learned each other's quirks and habits\u2014with such great variation in sleep schedules and timezones that ensured we could always count on having a team member awake at any hour of the day\u2014so that we could work with each other to build an app that gives us a sense of pride and accomplishment.\nIf we\u2019re being perfectly honest, each week felt like its own rollercoaster, with interviews, slides, presentations, websites, and deadlines forcing us to work around the clock to get it all done. However, looking back, we can all unanimously agree that each step was worth it. Each week, no matter how grueling, moved us closer to building a final product that we are excited to share with the world."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"In addition to our personal growth as a team, we also learned a lot about how to effectively design solutions to the problems around us.

The center of change is the people who can tell you about the problem in the first place.

Tell me more!\u201d Sure, we could have made a social media app that connects users to a feed of stories from their friends. But we thought, \u201cwhy not make buildings talk?\u201d When asked why we thought this was ever a good idea, we\u2019re not entirely sure.

We learned the importance of embracing mistakes early on, as those mistakes allow you to evolve your design into a product that is better suited for your users. As a team, we have learned the value of hyping each other up when morale is at its lowest. Most importantly, we learned that successful design projects are the ones that have the users in mind during each step. By keeping our interviewees in mind at every step of the way, we could always turn to each other and instead of saying \u201cdo we like this?\u201d, we could say \u201cwhat would Participant 1 think of this?\u201d"),Object(a.b)("p",null,"If this was a year long class (which it should be), then we would continue our iterative design process by improving functionality for users. We would want to ensure that users could search for stories anywhere in the world rather than just in Barcelona and San Francisco. We would incorporate a database that would allow users to listen to stories shared by users across the world within seconds. Additionally, we would incorporate some of our desired functionality that we could not implement given to time constraints. A navigation system would allow users to easily navigate to a story if they are close by. In addition, we would include the ability for non-English speakers to use the app by expanding the language options. Throughout, we would make sure to stay true to our mission of enabling cultural immersion through personal stories, empowering voices around the world."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0},89:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,"b",(function(){return a})),o.d(t,"a",(function(){return i}));var r=o(22),n=o(91);function a(){const{siteConfig:{baseUrl:e="/",url:t}={}}=Object(r.default)();return{withBaseUrl:(o,r)=>function(e,t,o,{forcePrependBaseUrl:r=!1,absolute:a=!1}={}){if(!o)return o;if(o.startsWith("#"))return o;if(Object(n.b)(o))return o;if(r)return t+o;const i=o.startsWith(t)?o:t+o.replace(/^\//,"");return a?e+i:i}(t,e,o,r)}}function i(e,t={}){const{withBaseUrl:o}=a();return o(e,t)}},91:function(e,t,o){"use strict";function r(e){return!0===/^(\w*:|\/\/)/.test(e)}function n(e){return void 0!==e&&!r(e)}o.d(t,"b",(function(){return r})),o.d(t,"a",(function(){return n}))},93:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,"a",(function(){return d})),o.d(t,"b",(function(){return f}));var r=o(0),n=o.n(r);function a(e,t,o){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:o,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=o,e}function i(e,t){var o=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var r=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(r=r.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),o.push.apply(o,r)}return o}function s(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var o=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?i(Object(o),!0).forEach((function(t){a(e,t,o[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(o)):i(Object(o)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(o,t))}))}return e}function l(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var o,r,n=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var o,r,n={},a=Object.keys(e);for(r=0;r<a.length;r++)o=a[r],t.indexOf(o)>=0||(n[o]=e[o]);return n}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(r=0;r<a.length;r++)o=a[r],t.indexOf(o)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,o)&&(n[o]=e[o])}return n}var c=n.a.createContext({}),u=function(e){var t=n.a.useContext(c),o=t;return e&&(o="function"==typeof e?e(t):s(s({},t),e)),o},d=function(e){var t=u(e.components);return n.a.createElement(c.Provider,{value:t},e.children)},p={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return n.a.createElement(n.a.Fragment,{},t)}},h=n.a.forwardRef((function(e,t){var o=e.components,r=e.mdxType,a=e.originalType,i=e.parentName,c=l(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),d=u(o),h=r,f=d["".concat(i,".").concat(h)]||d[h]||p[h]||a;return o?n.a.createElement(f,s(s({ref:t},c),{},{components:o})):n.a.createElement(f,s({ref:t},c))}));function f(e,t){var o=arguments,r=t&&t.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||r){var a=o.length,i=new Array(a);i[0]=h;var s={};for(var l in t)hasOwnProperty.call(t,l)&&(s[l]=t[l]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:r,i[1]=s;for(var c=2;c<a;c++)i[c]=o[c];return n.a.createElement.apply(null,i)}return n.a.createElement.apply(null,o)}h.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
