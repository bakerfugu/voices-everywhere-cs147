## 30 Second Pitch

If walls could talk, what could they tell you? What about the plazas, the statues, the fountains and the streets? 
Take yourself back to a place that was brand new to you, and imagine hearing authentic stories from locals everywhere you go. 
Presenting voices, where you can hear the culture and memories behind every landmark and street corner. 
Then, bring personal stories to life by adding your voice to your favorite places.
