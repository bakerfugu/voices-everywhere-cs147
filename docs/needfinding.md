We interviewed nine people over our week of needfinding. We found three things from our interviews

* Everyone wants to have a connection to the art they consume and interact with. 
* Generally speaking, people are more likely to trust recommendations from their friends. 
* Some people feel a tension between contributing and engaging with an artistic community while still feeling as if the connection is their own.
